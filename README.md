# CS224_MazeAlgorithm
A repository for the CS224 Algorithms project.

<strong>What you will need</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Eclipse</li>
  <li> Latest Java version (8u40 at time of creation)</li>
</ul>

<strong>What this program does </strong>
<p>This program is designed to solve a randomly generated maze as efficiently as possible using an algorithm comparable to that of the A*. This algorithm should also do so using the shortest path if there is more than one path to the end.</p>

<strong>How to run this program </strong>
<ul>
  <li>1. Download/pull the source code and open it in Eclipse. </li>
  <li>2. Under src/cs224.mazeCreator, run Maze.java. This will generate a maze to Output.txt. *</li>
  <li>3. Under src/cs224.mazeSolution, run Driver.java. This will solve the maze and show the output in the console (or txt file, tbd).</li>
</ul>
